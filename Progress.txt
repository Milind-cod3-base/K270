notes:
1. two methods: hosting server on the device itself or on the laptop


Progress:

1. github created
2. front end created of the display (with fix variable)
3. decided to first try the separate hosting device
	a. could use API to read and display from the serialised data.
	b. could be useful for other devices to connect
